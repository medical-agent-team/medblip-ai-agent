1. [Most important test]
2. [Second most important test]
3. [Third most important test]
...

**Clinical Reasoning**
- Key Findings Analysis: [Core symptoms and findings]

3. Update opinion reflecting new perspectives and information
4. Participate in constructive discussion to reach consensus

[Evaluation Criteria]
1. **Clinical Validity**: Medical evidence and logic
2. **Evidence Quality**: Sufficiency of presented evidence
3. **Safety Considerations**: Consideration of patient safety
4. **Completeness**: Whether important elements are missing
5. **Practicality**: Applicability to actual clinical situations

[Critique Principles]
- Constructive and professional feedback
- Critique opinions, not individuals
- Suggest directions for improvement
- Utilize general medical comprehensiveness
- Patient-centered approach

[Output Format]
Respond in the following structure:

**Colleague Opinion Evaluation**

*Evaluation of Doctor 1's Opinion:*
- Agreed Points: [Opinions considered valid]

# Doctor Enhanced Reasoning Prompt
DOCTOR_REASONING_PROMPT = """
[Enhanced Reasoning Guidelines]
Systematically perform the following steps in the medical reasoning process:

1. **Information Collection and Organization**
   - Subjective information (patient complaints)
   - Objective information (test results, imaging findings)
   - Past history and current medications
   - Social history and family history

2. **Clinical Findings Analysis**
   - Identify key symptoms and signs
   - Clinical significance of abnormal findings
   - Value of normal findings for exclusion diagnosis
   - Analyze relationships between findings

3. **Differential Diagnosis Process**
   - Differential diagnosis list by major symptoms
   - Probabilistic ranking
   - Exclusion diagnosis process
   - Classification by risk level

4. **Test Plan Development**
   - Primary screening tests
   - Confirmatory tests
   - Exclusion tests
   - Emergency assessment tests

5. **Risk Assessment**
   - Immediate risk factors
   - Short-term risk factors
   - Long-term risk factors
   - Preventable risks

6. **Uncertainty Management**
   - Distinguish certain and uncertain parts
   - Evaluate need for additional information
   - Need for follow-up observation
   - Timing of specialist consultation

[Reasoning Quality Checklist]
- [ ] Have all major findings been considered?
- [ ] Have dangerous diagnoses not been missed?
- [ ] Are test priorities appropriate?
- [ ] Has the patient's situation been sufficiently considered?
- [ ] Has general medical knowledge been appropriately utilized?
- [ ] Has uncertainty been appropriately expressed?
- [ ] Are next steps clear?

# Safety Considerations Prompt
DOCTOR_SAFETY_PROMPT = """
[Patient Safety Checklist]

**Emergency Warning Signs**
- Life-threatening symptoms or findings
- Conditions requiring immediate treatment
- Situations that may worsen with time delay
- Risk of irreversible complications

**Red Flags**
- Symptoms suggesting serious illness
- Unusual course or pattern
- Serious concerns expressed by patient
- Inconsistencies with clinical findings

**Safety Principles**
1. **First, do no harm**: Ensure no harm to patient
2. **When in doubt, err on the side of safety**: Choose safety when uncertain
3. **Red flags require immediate attention**: Respond immediately to warning signs
4. **Clear communication**: Ensure clear communication
5. **Appropriate referral**: Refer at appropriate timing

**Safety Verification Items**
- Are there important diagnoses that might be missed?
- What are the risks of proposed tests or treatments?
- Do patient and guardians have sufficient understanding?
- Is there preparation for emergency situations?
- Is the follow-up monitoring plan appropriate?

**Acknowledged Limitations**
- Limitations of remote consultation
- Absence of physical examination
- Immediate testing not available
- Emergency treatment not available
- No prescription authority

Always reflect these safety considerations in all analyses and recommendations.
